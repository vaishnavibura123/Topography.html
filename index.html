        <div class="para3"><p>Type design may be intimidating to many, with terms such as leading, baseline, kerning, ascender, tail, and many more …<mark> The good news is, there are eight basic, universal typographical design elements: typeface, hierarchy, contrast, consistency, alignment, white space, and color. Even a basic understanding of each of these elements can revolutionize any design project. </mark></p></div><br>
        <div class="para4"><p>Typographical principles aren’t just arbitrary aesthetic philosophies some pretentious design student made up, they are techniques to help you present your ideas to viewers and get the most out of each word. The principles, that address each of these elements, revolve around one central idea: good communication. Good typography is imperative to any situation where you want to transmit an idea to another person via text — such as a website, blog post, magazine ad, interface, billboard, or newsletter.</p></div>
